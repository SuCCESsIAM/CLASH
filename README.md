# CLASH
The Climate-responsive Land Allocation model with carbon Storage and Harvests (CLASH) is a global, biophysical land-use model. The model is designed to be embedded into integrated assessment models (IAMs) by including the file CLASH_Core.gms. In this role, CLASH represents the biophysical aspects of land-use (the annual production of food and other biomass for energy and materials, the change in terrestrial CO2 stocks and GHG emissions from agriculture). The IAM should provide the demand for these products, and any costs, policies and other societal constraints that affect land-use. CLASH can be also run stand-alone, please see the file CLASH_Wrapper.gms for an example.

The model is described in detail in the paper "CLASH - Climate-responsive Land Allocation model with carbon Storage and Harvests", published in Geoscientific Model Development: https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/17/3041/2024/
